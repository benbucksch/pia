# Pia

Personal Information Assistant

Pia is a voice assistant. You can talk to her and give her reasonably
natural commands and she will try to understand them and execute them.
The commands are defined by voice apps.

## Completely local

Pia works entirely local and without Internet connection.
Speech recognition and voice generation happen on your device,
not in the cloud. All your data stays on your device.
Local sync to other devices via Wifi is planned.
This is keeps information about your personal life private.

It also means that Pia can work in places where Internet connection
is intermittent, for example in your car.

To ensure that, Pia encourages apps that keep all their data local.
Cheap 200 GB microSD cards make this possible.

Obviously, Google searches, news, weather updates etc. will still
call out to the Internet.

## Context

Pia will keep context of what you said and allow you to make
follow up questions, e.g. using pronous like "it".
